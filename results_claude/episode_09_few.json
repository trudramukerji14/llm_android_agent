Among the available options (Display, Battery, Network), Display is the most logical choice as it contains settings related to screen appearance, brightness, themes, and display modes including dark mode.",
    "Since the goal is to enable dark mode and we're already in the Display settings where \"Dark Mode\" is available as a UI element, clicking on \"Dark Mode\" is the direct action needed to access and enable this feature."
